== GOALS for car-fighter port ==
[] read through entire rocket program and make sure I understand EVERYTHING about it.
To hold entities and render them to the screen
    all of them are rectangles
User Input
    [done] Keyboard
    [] Controller
        [done] joystick
        [done] buttons
        [done] make sure all controller actions are processed in each frame, not just one.
            Yup, for each poll_iter, perfect.
        [] decrease the dead-zone size for more accuracy
            OR keep it, but make it a better equation
Dot Physics
    [] change angle_radians to "turns", which I like better for angles.
        or "angle_turns"
    [] Fix Vector to have two vectors? (see TODO in vector.rs).
        Maybe stop using "vector" entirely, and put it all straight on Player.
    [] change all occurrences of PI to use TAU instead
    [] Acceleration
        [] change the up button so that it is acceleration instead of
           a constant speed boost
        [] change it to use RT instead of RB, and use that analogue-ness
        [] change the gun scatter so that it's a functions of the
           ship's acceleration or speed? Not sure which yet.
    [] Rotate
        More like, do exactly what the joystick does
Collisions being detected between objects
    NOT AABB, but all rectangular bounding boxes
Draw images to the screen
    with transparency in backgrounds
Lasers
    Death
    Set up targets to shoot
Multiple Players
